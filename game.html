		<p class="gameplay">Grand Theft Auto V is an action-adventure game played from either a third-person or first-person perspective.Players complete missions linear scenarios with set objectives to progress through the story. Outside of the missions, players may freely roam the open world. Composed of the San Andreas open countryside area, including the fictional Blaine County, and the fictional city of Los Santos, the world is much larger in area than earlier entries in the series.It may be fully explored after the game's beginning without restriction, although story progress unlocks more gameplay content.</p>

		<p class="gameplay">Players use melee attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies,and may run, jump, swim or use vehicles to navigate the world.To accommodate the map's size, the game introduces vehicle types absent in its predecessor Grand Theft Auto IV, such as fixed-wing aircraft.In combat, auto-aim and a cover system may be used as assistance against enemies.Should players take damage, their health meter will gradually regenerate to its halfway point.Players respawn at hospitals when their health depletes.If players commit crimes, law enforcement agencies may respond as indicated by a "wanted" meter in the head-up display (HUD).Stars displayed on the meter indicate the current wanted level (for example, at the maximum five-star level, police helicopters and SWAT teams swarm to lethally dispatch players).Law enforcement officers will search for players who leave the wanted vicinity. The meter enters a cool-down mode and eventually recedes when players are hidden from the officers' line of sight that displays on the mini-map.</p>

		<p class="gameplay">The single-player mode lets players control three characters: Michael De Santa, Trevor Philips and Franklin Clintonâ€”criminals whose stories interconnect as they complete missions. Some missions are completed with only one character and others feature two or three.Outside the missions, players may switch between characters at will by a directional compass on the HUD. The game may switch characters automatically during missions to complete specific objectives. A character's compass avatar will flash red if he is in danger and needs help, and flash white if he has a strategic advantage.Though players complete missions as any of the three protagonists, the more difficult heist missions require aid from AI-controlled accomplices with unique skill sets like computer hacking and driving. If an accomplice survives a successful heist, they take a cut from the cash reward and may be available for later missions with improvements to their unique skills.Some heists afford multiple strategies; in a holdup mission, players may either stealthily subdue civilians with an incapacitating agent or conspicuously storm the venue with guns drawn.</p>
